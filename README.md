## CuEVM updates: precompile contracts and tests

<div style="text-align: center;">

## Precompile contracts

- What are they?
  - special contracts built into the EVM
  - perform specific operations that would be costly or impractical to implement in
    regular Solidity code
  - typically implemented in the EVM execution engine

## CuEVM precompiles implementation status

<img src="./precompiles-status.png" width="100%" />

-  ecRecover, ecAdd, ecMul, and ecPairing. by Minh
-  Identity, Modexp, SHA-256 by Dan
-  Blake2f, RIPEMD-160 by CL

## Tests: ethereum/tests

ethereum/tests (https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
  - Test are defined in json files
    - it contains pre states and expected post stateRoot
    - <span style="color:red">a single test can contain transactions for different hard forks</span>
  - We used this to compare execution traces between REVM and CuEVM
  - <span style="color:red"> Test can take a long time to run (~17 minutes for SSTORE opcode test)</span>
  - Few EVMs can pass all the tests: http://retesteth.ethdevops.io/

## Tests: goevmlab

[goevmlab](https://github.com/holiman/goevmlab) tests protocol implemtations:
  - comparing results between different EVM implementations
  - generating and running Fuzz tests
  - tracediff: compare traces


Difference from ethereum/tests:
- only support single test in the input json
- some `post` information (stateRoot, logsRoot, etc) are ignored

## CuEVM + goevmlab: fuzz test

## CuEVM + goevmlab: Fuzz test example

``` bash
> generic-fuzzer --revme binaries/revm --geth geth \
    --cuevm ~/projects/sbip-sg/CuEVM/out/cpu_debug_interpreter --fork Shanghai
...
...

## goevmlab: Tracediff

``` bash
‚ùØ tracediff cuevm-0-output.jsonl geth-0-output.jsonl
```

<img src="./tracediff.png" width="800px" />

<!-- Caveats: -->
<!-- - no memory data -->
<!-- - no intermediate account storage data -->

---

## Problems with Fuzz test

Problems:
- has no contraol on what kind of tests to run
- the generated transaction can be very complex, not helpful for debugging failed tests

---

## CuEVM + goevmlab + ethereum/tests:

<img src="./current-test-goevmtest.png" width="800px" />

---

<!-- TODO a slide about current test results? -->


## Future work

- Implement all the precompiled contracts
- Fix test failures for both CPU and GPU implementations
- Peformance tuning
- Update to support the latest Cancun fork
- Compare log events
- Compute stateRoot in CuEVM
